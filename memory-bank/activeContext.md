# Active Context

## Current Focus

The initial design and implementation phase is complete. All core components of the meta-orchestrator have been designed, implemented, and documented as per the manifesto.

The immediate goal is to prepare for the next phase of development, which involves implementing the generalized training loop and beginning experimentation.

## Next Steps

1.  Implement the generalized training loop as designed in `docs/dynamic_training_design.md`.
2.  Create an initial set of experiments to establish a performance baseline.
3.  Begin the process of tuning the reward function and observation space based on experimental results.
