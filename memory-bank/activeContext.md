# Active Context

## Current Focus

The immediate goal is to implement the first item from the `meta_orchestrator_design_manifesto.md`:

**[1.1] Uni-directional Pipeline:** Formalize the state machine for the `Exploration` -> `Exploitation` -> `Termination` lifecycle.

## Next Steps

1.  Create a new design document to formalize the state machine. This document will detail the states, transitions, and conditions.
2.  Implement the core logic for this state machine within the `RLOrchestrator` framework.
3.  Update the manifesto to mark this item as complete.
